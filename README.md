🍽️ How to Use the Food Menu
The food menu is divided into three luxury tiers: Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner.

Navigation: Use the "VIEW MENU" tag on the menu.php amenities card to jump directly to the dining section.

Arched Layout: Every dish is housed in a standardized arched container.

Best Sellers: Look for the ★ BEST SELLER tag above premium items like the Beef Wellington or Eggs Benedict.

Interactivity: Click on any food item to see its detailed description, curated for a Michelin-star experience.

🛏️ Room Reservations
Explore Rooms: Scroll to the Luxury Rooms section on the home page.

Quick View: Click on a room photo to trigger the Modal Gallery.

Data Integrity: All room prices and sizes are pulled dynamically from rooms.json.

Booking: Use the "Proceed to Reservation" button to finalize your dates via reservation.php.

🛠️ Contribution Rules (Important!)
To avoid breaking the repository, please follow these rules established by Red:

No ZIP Files: Never upload .zip files directly to GitHub. If you have new photos, put them in the /images folder individually to avoid the 100MB limit.

Alignment Checks: If you add a new menu item, always include the <div class="tag-space"></div> tag, even if it's empty, to keep the grid aligned.

Mobile First: Always test your changes in Chrome DevTools preset to ensure the layout remains responsive.
